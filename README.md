# PhotoJourney
An app for a user to create a secure journal based around photos.This UI uses flexbox with secure registeration and login components using bcrypt, json web tokens, and schema controls in MongoDB. The backend uses express router to implement the MVC architecture to promote separation of concerns and future scalability.
This app also uses a photo upload/preview component using React Dropzone and Multer to allow the client to easily add photos and captions to their journal.
